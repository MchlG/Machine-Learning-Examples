## Polynomial-Regression
A simple example of polynomial regression on a dataset representing the square_root function. The dataset was generated by using the square_root function and then by adding a random degree of variance to each output.

The file main.m was written in Octave however it should work in Matlab too. To run main.m...</br>
-install Octave (or Matlab) </br>
-download the file along with the file containing the data (square-root-data.txt)</br>
-put both files together in the same folder</br>
-cd to the folder via terminal</br>
-initiate Octave then run 'main'
